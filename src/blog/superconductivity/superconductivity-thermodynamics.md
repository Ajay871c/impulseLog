### 🔁 Previously in This Series (Part 4)

In [Part 4](/type1-vs-type2-superconductors), we compared **Type I and Type II superconductors**. While Type I completely expel magnetic fields below a critical field, Type II allow magnetic flux to penetrate via quantized vortices. We explored their classification through the Ginzburg–Landau parameter $$\kappa$$ and discussed why Type II superconductors dominate modern tech applications.

## 🌡 What Does Thermodynamics Tell Us About Superconductivity?

Superconductivity isn’t just about zero resistance or expelling magnetic fields—it also involves a **dramatic shift in thermodynamic state**. This transformation is governed by:

-   **Free energy**
-   **Entropy**
-   **Specific heat**
-   **Phase transitions**

Let’s break these concepts down as they apply to superconductors.

## 🌀 The Superconducting Phase Transition

Superconductivity arises below a material's **critical temperature** $$T_c$$. This is not a chemical reaction or structural shift—it’s a **second-order phase transition**.

### 🧾 What is a Second-Order Phase Transition?

In thermodynamics, a **second-order (continuous) transition** is marked by:

-   **No latent heat** (no sudden energy jump)
-   **Continuous first derivatives** (entropy, volume)
-   **Discontinuous second derivatives** (specific heat, susceptibility)

Superconductors undergo this kind of transition at $$T_c$$, where:

-   Entropy changes **gradually**
-   Specific heat shows a **finite jump**

This is different from first-order transitions (like melting), which involve abrupt state changes and latent heat.

## 🧮 Free Energy: The Thermodynamic Foundation

In equilibrium thermodynamics, the **Gibbs free energy** $$G$$ tells us which phase is stable.

Below $$T_c$$, the Gibbs free energy of the superconducting state ($$G_s$$) is **lower** than that of the normal state ($$G_n$$):

$$
\Delta G = G_s - G_n < 0
$$

This negative difference explains why the system prefers to **enter the superconducting state**—it's thermodynamically favorable.

When an external magnetic field is applied, this energy balance shifts. The system transitions back to the normal state when it becomes more energetically favorable.

## 🔥 Specific Heat: A Signature Jump at $$T_c$$

The **specific heat** ($$C$$) measures how much energy is required to raise the temperature of a system.

For superconductors:

-   Below $$T_c$$: $$C_s < C_n$$ (for some range)
-   At $$T_c$$: **Sharp discontinuity**

In BCS theory, this jump can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{C_s - C_n}{C_n} \approx 1.43
$$

This specific heat anomaly is a **classic fingerprint** of superconductivity and is often measured to confirm the transition.

## 🧊 Entropy: Ordered State Below $$T_c$$

Entropy ($$S$$) quantifies disorder. Since superconductors exhibit a **more ordered quantum state** (with coherent Cooper pairs), their entropy is **lower** than in the normal metallic state:

$$
S_s < S_n
$$

This behavior aligns with the second law of thermodynamics—the system evolves toward a **lower-energy, lower-entropy state**.

Importantly, the **entropy difference vanishes at $$T_c$$**, ensuring continuity across the transition:

$$
\Delta S = S_s - S_n \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad T \to T_c
$$

---

## 🧲 Magnetic Field and Free Energy

In the presence of a magnetic field $$H$$, the difference in Gibbs free energy becomes field-dependent:

$$
G_s(H) = G_s(0) + \frac{H^2}{8\pi}
$$

At the **critical field** $$H_c$$, the energies of the superconducting and normal states become equal:

$$
G_s(H_c) = G_n
$$

This defines the **point of magnetic breakdown**—a field strong enough to suppress superconductivity thermodynamically.

## 📊 Ginzburg–Landau Free Energy Functional

In Ginzburg–Landau (GL) theory, the superconducting state is described by a **complex order parameter** $$\psi(\mathbf{r})$$, and the free energy density takes the form:

$$
F = F_n + \alpha |\psi|^2 + \frac{\beta}{2}|\psi|^4 + \frac{1}{2m^*}|(-i\hbar\nabla - 2e\mathbf{A})\psi|^2 + \frac{|\mathbf{B}|^2}{8\pi}
$$

-   $$\alpha$$ changes sign at $$T_c$$
-   $$\beta > 0$$ ensures stability
-   The last two terms account for kinetic energy of supercurrents and magnetic field energy

Minimizing this functional leads to the **Ginzburg–Landau equations**, which predict many thermodynamic properties and vortex behavior.

We'll explore this further in the next post.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

-   Superconductivity involves a **second-order phase transition**
-   The superconducting state has **lower entropy and free energy**
-   A **specific heat jump** is a critical signature at $$T_c$$
-   External magnetic fields modify the **free energy landscape**, leading to breakdown at $$H_c$$

Thermodynamics provides a **macroscopic lens** through which we understand why superconductors emerge and how they behave under stress.

### 🔮 Coming Up Next (Part 6)

In [Part 6](/london-equations-superconductivity), we will explore the **London equations**, which describe how magnetic fields decay inside superconductors and give rise to the **Meissner effect**. We’ll derive these equations and explain what they mean for real-world materials.
