## 🚄 2. Maglev (Magnetic Levitation) Trains

**Superconducting maglev trains**, notably in Japan, use **YBCO-based tiles** to create **repulsive forces** via the **Meissner effect** and **flux pinning**.

### Benefits:

- **Frictionless, contactless motion**  
- **Speeds >600 km/h**  
- **Quiet and low-maintenance operation**

Ongoing trials in Asia and Europe suggest that superconducting maglev will become a key player in **next-gen transportation**.
