## üîÅ Previous Post Recap

In [Part 6](/london-equations-superconductivity), we studied the **London equations**, which describe how electromagnetic fields behave in superconductors, particularly how magnetic fields decay over a length scale called the **London penetration depth**.

While insightful, these equations are phenomenological ‚Äî they don‚Äôt explain **why superconductivity occurs** or how it **emerges from microscopic principles**.

This brings us to the **Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory** ‚Äî a more powerful, quantum-inspired model that captures both thermodynamic and electromagnetic behavior.

## üåå What is Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau Theory?

The **Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau (GL) theory**, proposed in 1950 by **Vitaly Ginzburg** and **Lev Landau**, is a **macroscopic quantum theory** of superconductivity. It introduces a **complex order parameter** that varies smoothly through space, offering a quantum-mechanical yet spatially averaged view of superconductivity.

The order parameter is denoted as:

$$
\psi(\mathbf{r}) = |\psi(\mathbf{r})| e^{i\theta(\mathbf{r})}
$$

Here:

-   $$|\psi|^2$$ represents the **density of superconducting electrons**
-   $$\theta$$ is the **quantum phase**

This wavefunction-like parameter becomes **nonzero** in the superconducting state and vanishes above the critical temperature $$T_c$$.

## üßÆ Free Energy Functional

GL theory builds on the idea of **minimizing the free energy** of a superconductor. The total free energy is expressed as:

$$
F = F_n + \alpha |\psi|^2 + \frac{\beta}{2} |\psi|^4 + \frac{1}{2m^*} \left| \left( -i\hbar \nabla - 2e\mathbf{A} \right) \psi \right|^2 + \frac{|\mathbf{B}|^2}{2\mu_0}
$$

Where:

-   $$F_n$$ is the free energy of the normal state
-   $$\alpha, \beta$$ are phenomenological parameters
-   $$\mathbf{A}$$ is the magnetic vector potential
-   $$\mathbf{B} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$$ is the magnetic field

This functional includes:

-   **Thermodynamic terms** ($$\alpha |\psi|^2 + \beta |\psi|^4$$)
-   **Kinetic energy** of supercurrents
-   **Electromagnetic energy**

## üßæ Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau Equations

By minimizing the free energy with respect to $$\psi^*$$ and $$\mathbf{A}$$, we obtain two coupled differential equations ‚Äî the **GL equations**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ First Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau Equation:

$$
\alpha \psi + \beta |\psi|^2 \psi + \frac{1}{2m^*} \left( -i\hbar \nabla - 2e\mathbf{A} \right)^2 \psi = 0
$$

This governs the **spatial variation of the order parameter** under electromagnetic influence.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau Equation:

$$
\mathbf{J}_s = \frac{2e\hbar}{m^*} \text{Im} \left[ \psi^* \left( \nabla - \frac{2ie}{\hbar} \mathbf{A} \right) \psi \right]
$$

This expresses the **supercurrent density** in terms of the wavefunction and magnetic vector potential.

## üìè Coherence Length and Penetration Depth

GL theory naturally introduces two important characteristic lengths:

### 1. **Coherence Length** ($$\xi$$):

Describes the length scale over which $$\psi$$ can vary:

$$
\xi = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^* |\alpha|}}
$$

It characterizes how quickly the superconducting state can recover spatially from a disturbance (e.g., near a boundary or defect).

### 2. **London Penetration Depth** ($$\lambda$$):

Still defined as the scale over which magnetic fields decay, but now explicitly tied into the GL framework.

## ‚öñÔ∏è The GL Parameter Œ∫ and Superconductor Types

The **Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau parameter** $$\kappa$$ is defined as:

$$
\kappa = \frac{\lambda}{\xi}
$$

This single ratio determines whether a material is:

-   **Type I**: $$\kappa < \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$
-   **Type II**: $$\kappa > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

So, **GL theory unifies classification and field behavior** ‚Äî a major leap forward over the London model.

## üß™ Physical Predictions and Successes

Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory can:

-   Describe the **interface** between normal and superconducting regions
-   Model **vortex structures** in Type II superconductors
-   Predict **critical field behavior**
-   Bridge thermodynamics and quantum mechanics
-   Enable **computational simulations** of superconducting domains

In 2003, **Ginzburg shared the Nobel Prize in Physics** (with Abrikosov and Leggett) for his foundational contributions to superconductivity.

## üìò Conclusion

The Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory offers a **conceptual bridge** between macroscopic thermodynamics and microscopic quantum mechanics. Its introduction of a **spatially varying order parameter** allows us to model and predict complex superconducting phenomena ‚Äî from magnetic field penetration to vortex lattice formation.

## üîÆ Coming Up Next‚Ä¶

In [Part 8](/bcs-theory-cooper-pairs), we‚Äôll dive into the **BCS theory**, which finally explained the microscopic origin of superconductivity. We‚Äôll understand **Cooper pairs**, **energy gaps**, and the true nature of the superconducting quantum ground state.

Stay tuned as we zoom into the quantum world even further!
