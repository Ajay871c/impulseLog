#### 🧪 Recap of the Previous Post

In [Part 3](/superconductivity-experiments-history), we explored the **historical milestones** in superconductivity: from Onnes’s discovery to the Meissner–Ochsenfeld effect and the early classification of superconducting materials.

## 🧲 Type I and Type II Superconductors: A Scientific Overview

Superconductors are broadly classified into **two distinct types** based on their magnetic behavior and response to external fields: **Type I** and **Type II**. Understanding these categories is essential for both theoretical physics and real-world applications.

---

## 🔹 Type I Superconductors

Type I superconductors are generally **pure elemental metals** such as mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and aluminum (Al). They exhibit a **sharp transition** into the superconducting state, characterized by:

-   **Zero electrical resistance**
-   **Complete magnetic field expulsion** (Meissner effect)

However, this superconducting state is maintained only **below a single critical magnetic field** $$H_c$$. If the external field exceeds this threshold, superconductivity is entirely destroyed, and the material returns to the normal (resistive) state.

### 🔬 Key Characteristics:

-   **Critical field**: One well-defined value ($$H_c$$)
-   **Perfect diamagnetism** up to $$H_c$$
-   **Simple phase diagram**
-   **Low critical temperature** ($$T_c$$), typically < 10 K
-   **Used primarily in theoretical studies**, not practical for high-field applications

## 🔹 Type II Superconductors

Type II superconductors are usually **metal alloys** or **ceramic-based materials** like **NbTi**, **YBCO**, or **Bi-2212**. They are significantly more complex in behavior and structure but are **far more useful** for applications requiring high magnetic fields and current densities.

Instead of exhibiting an all-or-nothing response to magnetic fields, Type II superconductors allow **partial penetration of magnetic flux** through **quantized vortices**, resulting in a **mixed state**.

### 🧪 Two Critical Fields:

-   **Lower critical field** $$H_{c1}$$: The field strength at which magnetic vortices begin to penetrate the material.
-   **Upper critical field** $$H_{c2}$$: The field beyond which superconductivity is entirely destroyed.

### 🌪️ Mixed State:

In the region $$H_{c1} < H < H_{c2}$$, the superconductor contains a **lattice of magnetic vortices**, each carrying a single quantum of flux:

$$
\Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e} \approx 2.07 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{Wb}
$$

Despite the magnetic field inside, **electrical current still flows without resistance**.

### 🔬 Key Characteristics:

-   **Two critical fields**: $$H_{c1}$$ and $$H_{c2}$$
-   **Mixed state** allows higher field tolerance
-   Common in high-$$T_c$$ materials
-   Crucial in **MRI, maglev, particle accelerators, quantum devices**

## 📐 Classification Criterion: Ginzburg–Landau Parameter ($$\kappa$$)

The distinction between Type I and II superconductors is quantitatively defined using the **Ginzburg–Landau parameter**:

$$
\kappa = \frac{\lambda}{\xi}
$$

Where:

-   $$\lambda$$ is the **London penetration depth**
-   $$\xi$$ is the **coherence length**

### Interpretation:

-   $$\kappa < \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ → **Type I superconductor**
-   $$\kappa > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ → **Type II superconductor**

This parameter essentially compares how deeply a magnetic field can penetrate to how coherent the superconducting state is over space.
