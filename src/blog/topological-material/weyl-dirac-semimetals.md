## Weyl and Dirac Semimetals: Exotic Fermions in Crystals

### Introduction: Where High-Energy Physics Meets Condensed Matter

In the previous post, we explored the Quantum Spin Hall Effect — a 2D topological phase protected by spin and symmetry. Now, we ascend into a new realm where **electrons inside crystals behave like relativistic particles** from quantum field theory. Welcome to the world of **Weyl and Dirac semimetals**.

These topological phases don’t require an insulating gap. Instead, they host **gapless points in their band structures** — where energy bands cross linearly, creating quasiparticles that mimic **Weyl or Dirac fermions**. First predicted in high-energy physics, these fermions now emerge in the solid-state lab, complete with **chiral anomalies**, **Fermi arcs**, and **topological transport phenomena**.

### Introduction to Weyl and Dirac Fermions

#### Dirac Fermions:
- Originally described by the **Dirac equation**, these are **massless**, **spin-½** particles that preserve both **time-reversal** and **inversion symmetry**.
- In crystals, a **Dirac point** is formed by the overlap of two **Weyl points** with opposite chirality.

#### Weyl Fermions:
- Predicted in 1929 but long considered unobservable, Weyl fermions emerge when **either time-reversal or inversion symmetry is broken**.
- They act as **chiral particles** — having a handedness (left or right).
- In condensed matter, Weyl nodes appear in pairs and act as **monopoles of Berry curvature**.

These fermions are **not fundamental particles** here, but **quasiparticles** — emergent excitations arising from the topological structure of electronic bands.

### What Makes Weyl and Dirac Semimetals Unique?

Weyl and Dirac semimetals are not traditional metals or insulators. Their distinctive features include:

- **Linear dispersion** in all three spatial dimensions near node points.
- **Topologically protected band crossings** (Weyl/Dirac nodes).
- **Extremely high mobility** of carriers due to linear dispersion.
- **Fermi arcs** — surface states that connect Weyl nodes of opposite chirality.

Unlike conventional semimetals, their electronic behavior is dictated by **topological invariants** and **Berry curvature**, making them sensitive to magnetic fields, geometry, and symmetry.

### Fermi Arcs and Chiral Anomaly

#### Fermi Arcs:
- In Weyl semimetals, surface states form **open-ended arcs** in momentum space.
- These arcs connect projections of bulk **Weyl nodes of opposite chirality** on the surface Brillouin zone.
- This violates traditional expectations where Fermi surfaces must form closed loops.

#### Chiral Anomaly:
- A quantum mechanical effect where **chirality is not conserved** in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields.
- In Weyl semimetals, this results in **negative magnetoresistance** — conductivity increases with magnetic field.
- It is a **transport signature** of the topological nature of the system.

These phenomena offer **experimental fingerprints** that distinguish Weyl and Dirac semimetals from ordinary materials.

### Real Examples: TaAs, Na₃Bi

Several real-world materials have been confirmed to host these exotic quasiparticles:

#### Weyl Semimetals:
- **Tantalum arsenide (TaAs)**: The first Weyl semimetal observed experimentally.
  - Exhibits clear Fermi arcs via ARPES.
  - Demonstrates chiral anomaly in transport measurements.
- **NbAs, TaP**: Similar behavior with strong spin-orbit coupling.

#### Dirac Semimetals:
- **Na₃Bi**: A 3D Dirac semimetal protected by crystal symmetries.
- **Cd₃As₂**: Known for ultrahigh mobility and large magnetoresistance.

These materials have **band structures tuned by symmetry**, allowing transitions between trivial, Dirac, and Weyl phases by breaking specific symmetries.

### Experimental Techniques to Probe Weyl/Dirac Semimetals

Unveiling the topological features of these materials requires cutting-edge methods:

- **ARPES (Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy)**: Directly maps band structures and surface states, revealing Fermi arcs.
- **Magnetotransport Measurements**: Detect signatures of chiral anomaly through field-dependent conductivity.
- **Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)**: Visualizes local density of states and quasiparticle interference.
- **Quantum Oscillation Experiments**: Reveal Berry phase effects and topological signatures in Landau levels.

Together, these tools confirm the **existence and stability** of Weyl and Dirac nodes — and help identify new candidate materials.

### Emerging Applications

While still early-stage, these materials are being explored for:

- **Topological electronics**: Devices using robust, high-speed surface states.
- **Valleytronics**: Utilizing the chirality of Weyl fermions as an information carrier.
- **Spin-based logic**: Leverage spin-momentum locking for low-power computing.
- **Quantum sensing**: High mobility and Berry curvature make these systems sensitive to magnetic field variations.

Their unusual physical properties make them attractive for **quantum devices**, **next-gen transistors**, and even **gravitational wave analog studies**.

### Conclusion: Crystalline Portals to Quantum Relativity

Weyl and Dirac semimetals blur the lines between high-energy physics and materials science. They transform **relativistic equations** into tangible electronic states, unlocking rich quantum behaviors in tabletop experiments.

In the next post, we shift into a superconducting framework — exploring how topology combines with electron pairing to give rise to **Majorana modes** and **topological superconductors**.
