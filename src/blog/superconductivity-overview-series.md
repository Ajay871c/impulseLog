### 🧊 What is Superconductivity?

**Superconductivity** is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where a material exhibits **zero electrical resistance** and **expels magnetic fields** when cooled below a certain **critical temperature ($$T_c$$)**. These two hallmark traits—**perfect conductivity** and the **Meissner effect**—distinguish superconductors from ordinary conductors.

### 🧪 A Brief History

Superconductivity was first discovered in **1911** by Dutch physicist **Heike Kamerlingh Onnes**, who observed that mercury’s electrical resistance **vanished** suddenly at **4.2 K**.

#### Milestones:
| Year | Discovery | Contributor |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1911 | Zero resistance in mercury | H. K. Onnes |
| 1933 | Meissner–Ochsenfeld effect | W. Meissner & R. Ochsenfeld |
| 1957 | BCS theory | Bardeen, Cooper, Schrieffer |
| 1986 | High-temperature superconductors | Bednorz & Müller |

### ⚡️ Key Features

| Property           | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Zero Resistance** | No voltage drop across a current-carrying superconductor |
| **Meissner Effect** | Magnetic field expulsion from inside a superconductor |
| **Critical Temperature ($$T_c$$)** | The maximum temperature for superconductivity to occur |
| **Perfect Diamagnetism** | Magnetic susceptibility $$\chi = -1$$ in the ideal case |
