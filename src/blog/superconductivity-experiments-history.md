### 🔁 **Previously in This Series (Part 2)**

In [Part 2](/superconductor-properties-zero-resistance-meissner), we explored the **core properties of superconductors**: zero resistance, the Meissner effect, and the critical thresholds that govern their behavior. We also introduced two essential length scales—**penetration depth** and **coherence length**—that control how superconductors interact with magnetic fields and external currents.

## 🧪 Rewinding the Clock: The Experimental Genesis

Superconductivity wasn't discovered through theory—it was stumbled upon in the lab. And like many great discoveries in science, it began with a **simple curiosity** and a lot of **liquid helium**.

The story starts in **Leiden, Netherlands**, in the early 1900s, where **Heike Kamerlingh Onnes** was obsessed with understanding how materials behave at **ultra-low temperatures**. His laboratory had become the world leader in producing **liquefied gases**, culminating in the **liquefaction of helium** in 1908—a major milestone at the time.

This gave him a tool no one else had: the ability to cool materials down to just a few degrees above absolute zero.

## ⚡ The 1911 Discovery: Mercury and Zero Resistance

In **1911**, Onnes and his assistants were measuring the resistance of **solid mercury** as it was cooled down using **liquid helium**. They expected the resistance to decrease gradually, as is typical in metals. But what they found was completely unexpected:

At around **4.2 K**, the electrical resistance of mercury didn't just **decrease**—it **vanished**.

> "_The resistance at 4.2 Kelvin suddenly dropped to an immeasurably small value._"

This wasn’t just a better conductor—this was something **entirely new**. Onnes had discovered a new state of matter, where electrical current could **flow without any energy loss**.

He called this new state: **superconductivity**.

## 🧊 The 1933 Meissner–Ochsenfeld Experiment: More Than Just Zero Resistance

It wasn’t until **two decades later**, in 1933, that **Walter Meissner** and **Robert Ochsenfeld** made a crucial discovery: superconductors don’t just allow current to flow freely—they also **expel magnetic fields**.

They placed a superconducting tin sample in a magnetic field and then cooled it below its critical temperature. They found that the magnetic field **disappeared from the interior** of the material.

This effect, now called the **Meissner Effect**, proved that superconductivity was **not just perfect conductivity**. It was a **distinct thermodynamic phase** with its own rules.

This was the birth of **superconducting electrodynamics**.

## ⚛️ The First Signs of Quantum Behavior

The Meissner effect hinted at something deeper. Unlike regular conductors, superconductors obey **quantum mechanical laws on a macroscopic scale**. Their response to fields was governed by collective, coherent electron behavior.

Yet, physicists still lacked a solid **theoretical foundation** to explain why electrons would behave this way—until the **BCS theory** decades later.

But before theory could catch up, **more experiments were unraveling nature’s clues**.

## 🧪 The Rise of Type II Superconductors

In the mid-20th century, researchers found that some materials didn’t behave like classic superconductors (now called **Type I**). Instead, they **allowed partial magnetic field penetration** in the form of **quantized vortices**.

This was the beginning of **Type II superconductivity**, which occurs in materials like **niobium-titanium (NbTi)** and **YBCO**. These materials have two critical magnetic fields:

- $$H_{c1}$$: Below this, full Meissner effect
- $$H_{c2}$$: Above this, superconductivity is destroyed
- Between these two, magnetic fields penetrate in **vortex states**

This behavior was critical for **real-world applications**, especially where strong magnetic fields are involved—like in **MRI machines** and **magnetic levitation**.

## 🧪 Other Pivotal Experiments

### ✅ Persistent Currents

One of the most striking demonstrations of zero resistance came from setting up a current in a superconducting loop. Even after **days, weeks, or years**, the current remains unchanged. No decay. No energy loss.

This confirmed that **resistance was truly zero**, not just very small.

### ✅ Flux Quantization

In the 1960s, researchers observed that magnetic flux through a superconducting loop only occurred in **discrete units** (quantized values). This proved that superconductivity involved **quantum coherence over macroscopic distances**.

The flux quantum is:
$$
\Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e}
$$

### ✅ Josephson Effects (Teaser for Part 9)

Soon after, **Brian Josephson** predicted that supercurrents could **tunnel** across an insulating barrier between two superconductors—another quantum phenomenon that would lead to **SQUIDs** and **quantum computing**.

## 🧠 Why These Experiments Matter

Each experiment didn’t just reveal new physics—it redefined what materials could do. They showed that:

- **Macroscopic quantum states** are possible.
- **Electrical resistance isn't inevitable**.
- **Magnetic fields can be manipulated** in entirely new ways.

Together, these experiments laid the **empirical foundation** for the entire field of superconductivity—before the theories were even ready to explain them.

### 🔮 Coming Up Next (Part 4)

Now that we've seen how superconductivity was uncovered in the lab, it's time to **categorize** what we’ve found. In **Part 4**, we’ll compare **Type I and Type II superconductors**, explore their magnetic behavior, and understand why Type II materials power the technologies of tomorrow.
